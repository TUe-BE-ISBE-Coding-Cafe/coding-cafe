	<p class="mb-4">
		The <strong>TU/e BE Coding CafÃ©</strong> is an informal, hands-on meetup for anyone at the Department
		of Built Environment at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) (or even outside BE) interested
		in writing and sharing code used in research. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer,
		you're welcome to join!
	</p>

	<p class="mb-4">Each session includes:</p>

	<ul class="mb-4 list-inside list-disc">
		<li>Short live demos and lightning talks</li>
		<li>Collaborative coding and help sessions</li>
		<li>Discussions on tools, practices, and reproducibility</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="mb-4">
		The goal is to create a space where researchers from all fields can share knowledge, learn
		together, and improve how we write and use software in research.
	</p>
	<h2 class="mb-6 text-3xl font-bold">Topics</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Each Coding CafÃ© session features a short presentation or demonstration, lasting up to 30
		minutes. These presentations are given by fellow attendees and rotate between technical and
		non-technical topics to keep things diverse and engaging.
	</p>
	<p class="mb-4">
		Weâ€™re always looking for enthusiastic contributors! If youâ€™d like to give a presentation at an
		upcoming session, please email Ã–zgÃ¼n Balaban to suggest a topic.
	</p>

	<h2 class="mb-6 text-3xl font-bold">Who can join?</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		The Coding CafÃ© is open to everyone: students, PhDs, postdocs, staff â€” anyone writing a script,
		a pipeline, or building software for their work. You do not need to be in ISBE chair, or even
		from BE Department to join as long as we have space we are happy to have you.
