This Coding Café session focused on how Docker helps researchers create reproducible environments for notebooks, scripts, and data workflows.

**Topics covered:**

- Software dependency issues and “dependency hell”
- What containers and container images are
- Docker’s role in research reproducibility
- Practical examples of Dockerfiles, volumes, and networking
- Step-by-step commands to run and manage containers

This session was designed to be accessible to researchers with basic command-line experience and aims to promote the use of containerization for reproducible and shareable research workflows.
